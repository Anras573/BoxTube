BoxTube
========

A YouTube JukeBox app buildt with AngularJS

Idea by [jgthms](https://github.com/jgthms/juketube) 

## Demo

[boxtube.andersborasmussen.dk](http://boxtube.andersborasmussen.dk/)

## Purpose

At parties, youtube is often used as the sole music provider. People queue the video that they want to hear.

## Features

BoxTube is an attempt to simplify this scenario.

* Single page app
* Ajax search
* Playlists (upcoming videos only)
* Automatic play (as soon as the current video ends)
* Mobile first design

## Requirements

You only need a valid [YouTube Data API v3 key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) to copy-paste in **main.js**.

## TODO
Rebuild the entire application in Angular 2.0
